# Giphify

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/hollandsgabe/giphify/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

Giphify is a web-based utility built with [React](https://reactjs.org) and [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org) along with the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) tool. Web Assembly is a new paradigm of the web programming that allows developers to use low-level languages such as C, C++, Rust and more to get their applications to the web in an almost native speed.
